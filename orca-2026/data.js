  // Merged from two watch recordings with a ~6.5 min stop between them, sitting between
  // mile 2 and mile 3. Kai's account, which settles it: the watch was not recording the
  // way he wanted and he stopped to sort it out. So the stop was a full standing recovery
  // rather than anything the session asked for, and the "3 continuous miles" of the
  // export's planMatch is not what happened -- it was 1 mi at pace, a break, then 2 mi at
  // pace. That is an easier session than the continuous three that were written.
  //
  // Which makes the heart rate worse, not better, and corrects the reading first recorded
  // here: mile 3's 166 is a mean across a restart ramp, not a steady state. HR fell
  // through the break and climbed back over the opening minutes of the mile, so 8:02/mi
  // was costing more than 166 by the end of it. Mile 2's 150 understates the cost the
  // same way from the other side -- it came straight off the 9:45 warm-up with HR still
  // catching up. Mile 4 is the one split carrying neither artifact, and it says 7:54/mi
  // cost 170 bpm. Read the progression as two ramps around a genuine ~170 steady state,
  // not as 150 -> 166 -> 170 of drift.
  //
  // The export scores mile 4 against a 7:56 goal pace and calls the session an interval

  // Worth holding next to the easy days from three weeks ago. Aug 13 ran 8:24/mi at

  // easy. Tonight is 141. Most of that is discipline rather than physiology -- he is
  // choosing to hold back where he used to drift -- but it is the change that makes
  // the aerobic base actually accumulate.
  //
  // Two data caveats, both from the export and neither affecting the read above.
  // Kai confirmed the watch lost wrist contact from 19:16:23 to 19:21:44 and he
  // adjusted it mid-run; those 52 samples read 92-110 bpm while he was running and are
  // invalid. They were dropped, not backfilled -- a synthesized sample is
  // indistinguishable from a measured one downstream. hrAvg 141 survives it: the 282
  // clean samples mean 141.59 against Apple's time-weighted 141, two methods agreeing
  // inside 0.6 bpm. The bad window sits entirely inside mile 1 (which ended 19:22:59),
  // so mile 1's displayed 145 comes from Apple's smoothed stream rather than the raw
  // one, and this session's Apple zone breakdown -- Zone 1 in particular -- is
  // contaminated and must stay out of any time-in-zone trend.

  // progressive, and it forced him to stop and walk: "barely able to walk at points." Gait was
  // altered, which is the exact condition the rule names. It is the second mile-6 onset in six
  // days and it is WORSE than the first — on Sep 13 he could adjust and keep running, on
  // Sep 19 he could not. The PT's cue and the pre-race foam rolling were both in force and
  // neither prevented it. This needs his PT's review before the next block is built, and it
  // must not be closed out on the pain-free finish. The export
  // says exactly that itself, and it is right.
  //
  // What the closing miles do to the easy explanations:
  //   Miles 11–13 ran 7:27 / 6:59 / 6:40 — his three fastest of the day — at HR 148/154 and
  //   278/300/314 W, against miles 4–7 at 7:42–7:46, HR 166–168, 258–278 W. Faster, at a lower
  //   heart rate, at higher power, on the leg that could not walk half an hour earlier. A
  //   muscle progressively failing under accumulated load does not do that. Whatever happened
  //   at mile 6 resolved rather than accumulated, and the walk sits between the two states.
  //   Overstriding is not it either: derived stride length was LONGER in the pain-free closing
  //   block (~1.27–1.42 m) than in the block where the pain built (~1.23–1.25 m).
  //
  // elevGainFt is missing from this pull and it is the field that would settle the most
  // interesting question on the page — faster at a lower heart rate usually means terrain, and
  // the course profile is the one thing that could explain miles 11–13 without physiology. Not
  // estimated. Worth a follow-up pull, or one question to Kai.
  //
  // The aerobic verdict, which is the good news and should not get buried under the knee:
  // 8:00/mi at 153 avg, against last year's untrained 8:30/mi at 166–176. Thirty seconds a mile
  // faster at a materially lower heart rate, and the steady block at 7:44/mi sat at 166–168 —
  // roughly where last year's entire race sat, 46 s/mi slower. The engine was never the
  // limiter. This race says so plainly, and it puts the limiter exactly where the project has
  // had it all along: the quad.
  //
  // Cadence held 167–171 throughout and did NOT sag in the closing miles (170/169/170/171),
  // which is the failure mode the music exists to guard. The 150 and 160 on miles 8–9 are the
  // walking values, not a fade.
  //
  // Splits carry powerW and cadenceSpm per mile rather than as prose in a flag, which is a
  // departure from the Sep 13 row. Fourteen paired values do not survive being flattened into
  // a sentence, and cadence is a named intervention in the knee plan — it belongs beside the
  // mile it was measured on. Nothing reads these fields yet; they are recorded, not rendered.

  //    on Sep 8 is not the comparison; that one is an evening-only sample taken across a 10pm
  //    run and is annotated above as not a resting measurement.
  // 2. It is provisional. The pull ran at 21:40 Pacific with the day still going, which is
  //    exactly the shape that got revised on Sep 3 (74 -> 75) and Sep 10 (79 -> 80). Both moved
  //    up by one, so expect this to settle at 89-90 rather than to fall.
  // 3. There is a five-day hole in front of it. HealthKit returned nothing for Sep 12 or 13 (the
  //    Sep 14 export says so in `missing`), and no pull covered Sep 14-16 at all. So the last
  //    known value before this is the 72 on Sep 11 -- a series low -- and there is no way to tell
  //    whether 89 climbed gradually or arrived at once. That absence is why this is one question
  //    for Kai rather than a trend.
  //
  // What makes it worth raising at all is that it does not stand alone: the same day's easy run
  // came in six beats above the Sep 13 long run at matched pace. Kai's stressful-day-plus-coffee
  // read explains both, and it is his run to describe. The reason to ask anyway is that early
  // illness explains both identically, and two days before a race the two have different
  // answers. No pain and no swelling, so the monitoring rule is not engaged.
  // CORRECTED Sep 19, and the correction closes the question the block above left open.
  //
  // Sep 17 is 83, not 89. The 89 came from a pull that ran at 21:40 with the day still going,
  // and the note above predicted it would "settle at 89-90 rather than fall." It fell. That
  // prediction was wrong in the one direction it ruled out, which is worth keeping visible:
  // the two prior revisions (Sep 3, Sep 10) both moved up by one, and two samples was not a
  // rule. A provisional reading is provisional in both directions.
  //
  // The five-day hole in front of it is also mostly filled now -- Sep 14, 15 and 16 arrived
  // with the race-day pull. The series reads 72 (Sep 11) -> [12-13 still missing] -> 74, 69,
  // 79, 83, 84. So the 89 was never a spike, and 69 on Sep 15 is a series low sitting right
  // in the middle of what looked like a climb. Read as a whole this is an ordinary taper: low
  // mid-week, drifting up over the last two days before a 7am start, which is what pre-race
  // nights do to resting heart rate.
  //
  // That closes the illness question the Sep 17 note raised. It was worth asking at the time
  // -- early illness and a stressful day explain an elevated reading identically, and two days
  // out they have different answers -- but nothing materialised, the race was run, and Kai's
  // stress-plus-coffee read stands. No follow-up needed.
